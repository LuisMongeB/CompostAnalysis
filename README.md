# CompostAnalysis
This code is meant to automate the analysis of data coming from compost bins for my brother's thesis in Biosystems Engineering. 

Data came from multiple sensors in Arduino inside of compost bins, in which 4 methods were applied.  

To avoid tools like Excel for the data analysis, which can do the same operations but it's slower and Python seemed the right approach to automate it. The idea being that the raw data generated by each compost bin can be downloaded as a .csv file and given as input to main.py in order to:

1. Clean data and export the clean csv;
2. Print and save some descriptive statistics about the the compost bin in a txt file;
3. Creating and saving plots necessary for the writing of the thesis.

The project structure goes as follows:

**Data:** where the initial input_csv will be.

**Graphs:** where the resulting graphs will be stored.

**Utils:** where you should go to understand what happens in main.py. Helper files.

**CompostReview:** where the txt file associated with the bin will be created.


## Running main

From the project directory main.py can run with an argument called **input_csv** that has to be added to point to the name of the csv INSIDE of the **Data** folder.
